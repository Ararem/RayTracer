# Todos

## Misc
* Swap floats to doubles and test the performance loss (might be preferable to use doubles everywhere instead of casting all the time)

## Materials/Textures
* Implement some actual textures other than plain colours
  * Images
  * Procedural (Noise)
* Add some sort of texturing to sky-boxes (HDRI images?)

## Debugging/Development
* Infinite rendering (no pass limit)
* Cancel render and return to main menu
* Reload scene from [Builtin Scenes](Core/BuiltinScenes.cs) while running (no restart app)
* Store scenes as files rather than C# properties
